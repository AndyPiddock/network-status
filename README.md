## Simple LiveCode network status indicator for Lan and Wi-Fi connections

Uses a shell out to "netsh interface show interface" to retrieve Ethernet and Wi-Fi status

script only stacks generated by Brian Milby's great ScriptTracker plugin https://github.com/bwmilby

The NetWork Status.livecode binary is self contained and can be used without the script only stacks.
 Script only stacks are for version control only.
